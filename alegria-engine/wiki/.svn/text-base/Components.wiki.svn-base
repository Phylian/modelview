#summary List of Components supported by the engine.

= Introduction =

Alegria Engine has a modular architecture, which is defined by Components. A Component adds information to the Entity who owns it. Besides, a Component has an associated Subsystem, which grabs that information and processes it. It's all very clear with an example:

We'll take the Render Component, for instance. The Render Component holds information regarding the graphical representation of the entity, i.e: an image, whether it'll be visible or not, etc. 

The Render Subsystem, on the other hand, iterates through all the Entities containing a Render Component, and, given its information, renders it on the screen.

Below is the list of the Components currently supported by the engine.


= Components =

|| *Component Name* || *Description* ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/alegria-engine/wiki/RenderComponent Render ] || Holds the render (visual) data of the entity. OpenGL will use this data. ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/alegria-engine/wiki/KeyboardComponent Keyboard]|| Gives the entity access to keyboard input. ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/alegria-engine/wiki/PhysicsComponent Physics]|| Holds the physical data of the entity. Box2d will use this data.||
|| Mouse || Gives the entity access to mouse input.||
|| Particle || Makes the entity act as a particle.||
|| ParticleSystem || Allows the entity to emit particles ||
|| Always || Allows the entity to trigger scripts at a regular interval (or just once)||
|| Message || Allows the entity to alert and be alerted through messages ||
