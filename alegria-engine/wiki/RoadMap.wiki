#summary Roadmap.

= Introduction =

Here I'll put info on what are the immediate priorities on the project.


= TO-DO LIST =

 * Memory corruption fixes.  (DONE)
 * Python referencing fixes.  (DONE)
 * Entity erasing.   (DONE)
 * Entity initial position/rotation/size  (DONE)
 * Entity attributes (a.k.a variables or properties) (DONE)
    * Support for different basic types like Int, Float, String, Bool.
 * Scene loader (DONE)
 * Physics subsystem (i.e. Box 2D integration) (DONE)
 * Message subsystem
 * Main engine functions (like CreateEntity) accessible from python.

After this there should be a break on the development in order to make the first demo. Then I'll organize the source code properly so people can download and compile it themselves, as well as provide the binaries. At this point the engine should be considered Released, I just can't wait for it!

When some other features, like particle systems and the AlegriaEd editor are done, I'll try to do some videos showing the engine in action.

After that... who knows what will happen "^^
